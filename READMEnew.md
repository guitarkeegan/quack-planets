  ## Description
 
  Quackathon project where we were tasked with creating an educational site about the planets of our solar system. A relational database and single page application were also required.

  ## Installation

  This application was built with NextJS. To run locally, clone the repo and in the command line type ```npm run dev```. Unfortunately, this will only work if you have your own database with the planet information setup.

  ## Usage

  > This site may be used as a simple educational tool to learn a bit about the planets and moons of our solar system.

  ## Contributions
  
  This project was created by Auroiah Morgan, Rick Rieger, and Keegan Anglim.

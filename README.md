  ## Description
 
  Quackathon project for the DearJuniorDev Discord server, where we were tasked with creating an educational site about the planets of our solar system. A relational database and single page application were also required. 

  ## Quackathon

  -- The website must be a SPA application.

  ### Planets:

  > -- Each planet of the solar system must have its own profile page.
  -- Each page must include at a minimum (Name of the planet, size, distance from the Sun, three identifying facts, solid or gas core, and a visual representation of the planet)
  -- NOTE: No images, assets, emojis, or SVGs are permitted. The visual representation of each planet must be made ENTIRELY out of CSS.
  -- If the planet has a moon, you must display the following information for every moon (Name, history behind name, and size). 
  -- Planet pages must include at least two different components that are NOT used on your homepage.
  -- If a planet has more than one moon, the moon information must be displayed in repeating elements.
  -- All planet and moon content MUST be stored in a database.


  ### Backend:

  > -- You must use foreign keys.
  -- Planets and Moons must be stored separate from one another.
  -- You must incorporate one ENUM for the planet data.

  ### Homepage:

  > -- The homepage should be an overview of the solar system.
  -- The data included will be up to each team.
  -- The homepage must include at least two components that are NOT used on any planet page.
  -- Homepage content does not need to be stored in a database and can be coded into your components.

  ### README:

  > -- Your README must include instructions for me to spin up the project locally, as well as an overview of the tech and/or libraries used.
  -- It should also include a list of the Quackathon requirements and how those were met or exceeded by your team.

  ## Fullfilled

  ## GettingStarted

  This application was built with NextJS. To run locally, clone the repo and in the command line type ```npm run dev```. This will only work if you have your own database with the planet information setup. If you'd like to see a live demo, scroll down to the link!

  ## Usage

  > This site may be used as an educational tool to learn a bit about the planets and moons of our solar system.
